# OrderEase - New Order Screen

## Overview
OrderEase is a Flutter-based application that allows users to place and manage their orders efficiently. This project focuses on implementing the **New Order Screen** with full localization support for **English (EN)** and **Hindi (HI)** using `flutter_localizations` and `.arb` files.

## Features
- **Multi-language Support**: Localized all user-facing strings for English and Hindi.
- **Real-time Order Summary**: Displays item name, quantity, price, selected address, and delivery date.
- **Delivery Address Selection**: Allows users to pick from saved addresses or add a new one.
- **Delivery Date Selection**: Users can specify their preferred delivery date.
- **Error Handling**: Displays appropriate messages when required fields are not selected.
- **State Management**: Utilizes `Provider` for managing order data, addresses, dates, and quantities.

## State Management Choice
This project uses **Provider** for state management due to its simplicity, efficiency, and ease of integration with Flutterâ€™s widget tree. Provider ensures:
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Only updates necessary widgets when data changes.
- **Scoped State Management**: Keeps business logic separate from UI components.
- **Lightweight & Performant**: No unnecessary rebuilds, leading to a smoother user experience.
